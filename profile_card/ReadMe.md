# Profile Card Portfolio

This is my **first frontend development project** ðŸŽ‰ â€” a profile card that serves as a portfolio introduction.  

---
## Design
- Designed the layout in **Figma**  
- You can view the design file [here](https://www.figma.com/design/sHhkqPMkq4jyOeIkbwRwl2/Untitled?node-id=0-1&t=VvdF4AGJ5HWpK7ae-1)  
- A preview of the design is also available in `design.png`

---
## Notes
- `card_comments.css` is included to help anyone reading the code understand what each line does
- This is my **MVP version** (Minimum Viable Product)

## Future Considerations

1. **Make it responsive**  
   - Ensure the card adapts to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).  
   - Use relative units, flexbox/grid, and media queries.  

2. **Support multiple profile cards**  
   - Instead of a single card, future versions will allow a grid or list of profile cards.  
   - Useful for showcasing different roles or services.  

3. **Add more interactions**  
   - Hover effects for links and icons.  
   - Smooth transitions or micro-interactions to make the card feel more engaging.
